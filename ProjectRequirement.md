# The Guideline for the Final Project

The final project is a major component of this course. Each student is expected to develop a **digital-geographies related project**. It can be a **web map**, a **smart dashboard**, a **geo-narrative**, or a project that has been approved by the instructor. All the final projects are expected to be published online, and the codes are expected to be shared on GitHub in order to contribute to both the open-source community and academia. The final project must satisfy the following items:

- Host your project on github. By doing so, your project can be visited via a url link such as `[username].github.io/[repo_name]`.

- In addition to the main feature of the digital-geographies (e.g. web map, smart dashboard, or geo-narrative), you should also show the **project title**, **a short description**, **legend**, **data sources**, and **acknowledgment** at easily found places on the web page.

- A `readme.md` describes your web map, including, but not limited to,
    - Project title
    - Project description
    - Project goal (such as, what is the message you want to deliver through your project?)
    - Data sources
    - Applied libraries (e.g., Leaflet, D3, C3) and Web Services (e.g., github, basemap) in use
    - Other things that are necessary to inform the audience.
    - Acknowledgment

## 2\. Presentation

Academics often attend conferences where they share their discoveries and browse the work of others to gain new ideas and offer feedback. We will hold a final presentation meeting on **March 16th, 4:30 to 7:30 PM**, each student is expected to present the final project in ~3 minutes, and plus another 1 minute for a Q&A session.

## 3\. Peer Review

During the final presentation, each student will need to share some constructive comments to at least **FIVE** of your classmates' final projects. The comments need to be submitted as a new GitHub issue to the presenter's final project repository. Your comment could start with something the presenter did well, and the list a few items the presenter could further improve.

## 4\. Submission

To submit your final project, you will need to share the url link of your final project's GitHub repository to a dedicated final project submission tab on Canvas by the end of the finals week on **Friday (March 19th) by 11:59 pm.**

>  **Note:** The requirements to the project may be slightly changed according the progress of this course. The final requirements are subject to the instructor's notification.
